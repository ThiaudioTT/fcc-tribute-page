            <h2>Biography</h2>

            <!-- Content -->
            <p> George Boole, (born November 2, 1815, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England—died December 8, 1864, Ballintemple, County Cork, Ireland), English mathematician who helped establish modern symbolic logic and whose algebra of logic, now called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra" target="_blank">Boolean algebra</a>, is basic to the design of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics" target="_blank">digital computer circuits</a>.</p>

            <p> Boole was given his first lessons in mathematics by his father, a tradesman, who also taught him to make optical instruments. Aside from his father's help and a few years at local schools, however, Boole was self-taught in mathematics. When his father's business declined, George had to work to support the family. From the age of 16 he taught in village schools in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and he opened his own school in Lincoln when he was 20. During scant leisure time he read mathematics journals in the Lincoln's Mechanics Institute. There he also read Isaac Newton's Principia, Pierre-Simon Laplace's Traité de mécanique céleste, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange's Mécanique analytique and began to solve advanced problems in algebra.</p>
            
            <p> Boole contracted pneumonia after walking three miles from his home to Queen's College in a rainstorm on November 24, 1864. He died on December 8.</p>
